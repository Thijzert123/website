### This modpack allows you to explore Minecraft in a different way and adds quality of life improvements, while keeping the vanilla aspect we all know and love

## Explore a new Minecraft you have never seen before!
This Minecraft modpack is mainly focused on the exploration aspect of Minecraft. It aims to improve rewards for wandering around and finding new structures. Key mods that take part in this field:
- Dungeons and Taverns: Adds lots of new structures around the world, including dungeons and taverns :)
- Explorify: Adds new structures in the overworld, Nether and the End
- Towns and Towers: Adds new villages, pillager outposts and ships to add more variation
- End Remastered: Explore at least 12 different structures to get unique Eyes of Ender that you need to activate the End Portal

## Be amazed of the new creatures you'll find!
During your journey through your good-looking Minecraft world, you are going to encounter dozens of new mobs, for example:
- New styles of already existing mobs, made possible by More Mob Variants: This mod gives old mobs lots of new variants they can spawn in. They drop the same, but make your world feel more fresh!
- Friends & Foes: Adds mobs that have been voted out in the mobvotes, and integrates them perfectly in your vanilla world
- Bosses of Mass Destruction: Adds 3 new bosses to defeat after you have beat the Ender Dragon

## Enjoy your overall Minecraft experience with quality of life mods!
There are a few quality of life mods, for example:
- Skin shuffle: Allows you to change your skin without exiting your game
- Toggleable Item Frames: Allows you to disable the rendering of item frames, enabling you to make beautiful worlds
- Your Items Are Safe: Puts your items in a chest and your armour on an armourstand if you die. This way other people are still able to get your items, but you won't have to worry about getting back before your items despawn
- Shulker Box Tooltip: Allows you to see what's inside of your shulkerboxes without placing them down
- Xaero's Minimap and World Map: Allows you to retrace your steps and mark down structures you want to visit later
